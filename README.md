## Web Scraping Tool

In my Data Visualization lecture we are developing a web scraping tool, that can plot the information about product.
With this tool we can see the current number of the items and save the all information in a csv file.
The tool is always updated. when it runs, first it checks the csv file if it is 10 minute old or not. If it is older
than 10 minutes it creates a new plot and csv file.

#### Note:
This tool is only developing for educational purpose.
